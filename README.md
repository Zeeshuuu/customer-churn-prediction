# 💡 Customer Churn Prediction Dashboard

An **AI-powered interactive dashboard** built with **Streamlit** that predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to **churn (leave the service)** or **stay**.  
This project uses multiple **machine learning models** trained on the **Telco Customer Churn dataset** and includes **explainable AI visualizations (SHAP)** to interpret model predictions in a business-friendly way.


## ✨ Key Features

✅ Predict customer churn using **Gradient Boosting (best model)**  
✅ Compare performance of multiple ML models — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting  
✅ Interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for real-time visualization and prediction  
✅ **SHAP explainability** to understand which features impact churn risk  
✅ Complete **data preprocessing**, feature scaling, and model saving  
✅ Extract valuable **business insights** from feature importance and customer behavior trends

📊 Dataset Information

Dataset: Telco Customer Churn (IBM Watson Analytics)
Rows: ~7,000 customer records
Columns: Demographics, services, contracts, and billing details
Target Column: Churn (Yes / No)

This dataset enables telecom companies to identify customers at risk of leaving and take proactive actions to reduce churn.

🧩 Model Training Workflow

Load and clean the Telco Churn dataset

Handle missing values in TotalCharges

Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding

Scale numerical features using StandardScaler

Train multiple models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

Gradient Boosting

Compare performance using Accuracy, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC

Save the best model and scaler for deployment
